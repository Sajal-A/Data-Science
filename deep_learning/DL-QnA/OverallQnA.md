# Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence

**What is AI?**
- AI is a broad field that encompasses the development of intelligent systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning,
learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI serves as an umbrella term for various techniques and approaches, including machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI, among others.

**What is ML?**
- ML is a type of AI for understanding and building methods that make it possible for machines to learn.
These methods use data to improve computer performance on a set of tasks.

**What is DL?**
- Deep learning uses the concept of neurons and synapses similar to how our brain is wired. An example of a deep learning application is Amazon Rekognition,
which can analyze millions of images and streaming and stored videos within seconds.

**What is GenAI?**
- Generative AI is a subset of deep learning because it can adapt models built using deep learning, but without retraining or fine tuning.
- Generative AI systems are capable of generating new data based on the patterns and structures learned from training data.

## MACHINE LEARNING FUNDAMENTALS
Building a machine learning model involves data collection and preparation, selecting an appropriate algorithm, training the model on the prepared data, 
and evaluating its performance through testing and iteration.

**What are the different ways of representing training data?**
- The machine learning process starts with collecting and processing training data. Bad data is often called garbage in, garbage out, and
therefore an ML model is only as good as the data used to train it. Although data preparation and processing are sometimes a routine process,
it is arguably the most critical stage in making the whole model work as intended or ruining its performance.
